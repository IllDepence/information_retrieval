Before starting to code
=======================
The exercise sheet began with "copy from ES8", the TIP file startet out with
"copy from ES2" -- or rather, "the exercise sheet asks you to copy from ES2",
which it didn't at first glance, but later on kind of did -- only to continue
with "copy from ES8 *or* ES9".
Facing this funny puzzle of convoluted code reuse right at the start of
tackling the exercise sheet was quite the motivation drainer.

General
=======
Didn't keep a close eye on the time. Spent most of Sunday afternoon + evening
coding and procrastinating from coding.

Related terms
=============
The highest rated entries seem to be terms that belong to set or typical
sentence patterns like festival+at as in "festival at <venue>" [1] or best+for,
award+for, etc.
A nice example for a more or less synonymous pair of terms is line 32 in my
term_paris.txt her+his.
Furthermore languages and words in these languages get teamed up, e.g. line 80
la+french. Nice. :)

[1] Inspection of the movies.txt file revealed that "festival at" actually only
appears a mere 5 times in total. Maybe sentences like "at the XY festival" or
so also played a role.
