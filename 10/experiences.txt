Instructions to re-use code from previous exercises were all over the place --
not in the sense that they were in different locations, but inconsistent and
unnecessarily hard to parse.
The exercise sheet began with "copy from ES8", the TIP file startet out with
"copy from ES2" -- or rather, "the exercise sheet asks you to copy from ES2",
which it didn't at first glance, but later on kind of did -- only to continue
with "copy from ES8 *or* ES9" for the read_from_file method.
