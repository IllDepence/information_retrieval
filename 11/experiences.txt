Lecture
=======
Since Bielefeld was included in exercise sheet 5's cities.txt -- merely as a
joke, I presume --, I was very relieved to see the truth hinted at in lecture
11 slide 15.

General
=======
It was *VERY* nice to be able to write code from scratch again. Not having to
work with code from a previous exercise sheet or otherwise given code makes it
way easier to get started in my opinion.
