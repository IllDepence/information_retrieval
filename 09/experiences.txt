General
=======
Took me the good part of Saturday afternoon+evening and a few more hours on
Sunday morning. I'd guess around 8 hours in total.

Having to think of all the clustering sub steps in terms of matrix operations
made my head hurt. In some instances the instant gratification monkey [1] may
have taken over and make me place .transpose()s and the like here and there
until the doctest ran through.

Discussion of centroids
=======================
Centroids seem to be centered around general themes, movie genres or even
ethnic/cultural characteristics (see run.txt).

Example "film festival centroid":
festival, entered, international, cannes, berlin, ...

Example "cartoon centroid":
animated, cartoon, short, looney, tunes, ...

Example "chinese martial arts centroid":
kong, hong, wong, chan, lau, cheung, martial, yuen, fu, ...

Example "spanish centroid":
de, la, el, argentine, mexican, del, en, al, luis, le, ...



Seeing these centroids and realizing that they're actually centered around
certain themes was the best part of the exercise. :)
