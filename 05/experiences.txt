Startup + 1.1 to 1.3 took me 2 hours.
1.4 to 1.7 took me 2.5 hours.

Lecture was easy to follow and introduced concepts interesting. The exercise
sheet was okay I guess. Didn't feel like I was gaining huge insigts but took
a considerable amount of time albeit not really feeling difficult. Maybe it's
just my not being "fluent" enough in Java to quickly hack together a solution,
resulting in an implementation time that doesn't seem worth the gain. Or it's
the fact that in order to be correctable with reasonable effort, the exercises
have to dictate a lot of structure (i.e. everything that's in the TIP file),
making the solving process more about adhering to the already given than coming
up with one's own solutions.
