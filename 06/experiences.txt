Didn't pay close attention to the clock this time. I guess it took me about 4
hours.
/edit: +a little bit more time now that I implemented something for ex 1.6.

Since most of it was shown in the lecture the Java stuff was pretty straight
forward â€” albeit way less fun than coding Python. The web part wasn't new for
me but nevertheless very enjoyable to do.

I liked this exercise sheet quite a lot.
