General
=======
Took me an hour to find out that
    [junit] expected:<[10, 20[]]> but was:<[10, 20[, 0, 0, 0, 0]]>
means there's allocated but unused space in my result array and junit doesn't like it.
Around 3-4 hours for the rest of the sheet.

The corresponding lecture was easy to follow. I like the live coding and hope we'll be allowed to used Python for the next sheet again. :)
